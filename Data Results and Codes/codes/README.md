# 1. Python install

I recommend to use python 3.X to run my codes.And the download link is:[Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

# 2. Packages

There are several packages needed for the codes.<br>
(1). pandas
the command to install is:
````
pip install pandas
````
(2). plotly
the command to install is:
````
pip install "notebook>=5.3" "ipywidgets>=7.2"
````
# 3. Run the codes
After you install python and packages above,you also need to download the data from `Data and Results and Codes`,and then you could run the codes and get the plots 
which are also included in `Data and Results and Codes`.


# Remark:I recommand [Anaconda](http://anaconda.com/downloads.html) to install `jupyter Notebook` for my codes,because if there may be some problems during installing the packages,then you could use Anaconda Prompt
to install them.For the packages,the commands are:<br>
(1). pandas
````
conda install pandas
````
(2). plotly
````
$ conda install -c plotly plotly=4.11.0
````
or
````
conda install plotly
````
